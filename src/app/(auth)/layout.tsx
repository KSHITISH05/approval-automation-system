/**
 * This file defines a React component that serves as a layout wrapper for the application or a section of it.
 * 
 * Key responsibilities and concepts:
 * 
 * 1. **Layout Component Purpose**:
 *    - Provides a consistent structure (such as header, footer, navigation, or sidebars) across multiple pages or views.
 *    - Acts as a container for child components, typically rendering them via `props.children`.
 * 
 * 2. **React + TypeScript**:
 *    - Uses TypeScript for type safety, often defining `Props` interfaces to specify what data or children the layout expects.
 *    - The component is usually a function component (`FC` or arrow function).
 * 
 * 3. **Common Usage**:
 *    - In frameworks like Next.js, `layout.tsx` is often used to wrap all pages, ensuring a uniform look and feel.
 *    - Can include global providers (e.g., theme, context), meta tags, or other elements that should be present on every page.
 * 
 * 4. **Typical Structure**:
 *    - Imports React and any required components or styles.
 *    - Defines a component that returns JSX, often with a structure like:
 *      <Header />
 *      <main>{children}</main>
 *      <Footer />
 *    - Exports the layout component as default or named export.
 * 
 * 5. **Example**:
 *    ```tsx
 *    import React from 'react';
 *    interface LayoutProps {
 *      children: React.ReactNode;
 *    }
 *    const Layout: React.FC<LayoutProps> = ({ children }) => (
 *      <>
 *        <Header />
 *        <main>{children}</main>
 *        <Footer />
 *      </>
 *    );
 *    export default Layout;
 *    ```
 * 
 * 6. **Gotchas**:
 *    - Ensure `children` is typed correctly to avoid TypeScript errors.
 *    - Be careful with nested layouts or multiple providers to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
 * 
 * In summary, this file is foundational for structuring the UI and ensuring consistency across your React application.
